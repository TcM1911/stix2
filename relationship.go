// Relationship object is used to link together two SDOs or SCOs in order to
// describe how they are related to each other. If SDOs and SCOs are considered
// "nodes" or "vertices" in the graph, the Relationship Objects (SROs)
// represent "edges".
//
// STIX defines many relationship types to link together SDOs and SCOs. These
// relationships are contained in the "Relationships" table under each SDO and
// SCO definition. Relationship types defined in the specification SHOULD be
// used to ensure consistency. An example of a specification-defined
// relationship is that an indicator indicates a campaign. That relationship
// type is listed in the Relationships section of the Indicator SDO definition.
//
// STIX also allows relationships from any SDO or SCO to any SDO or SCO that
// have not been defined in this specification. These relationships MAY use the
// related-to relationship type or MAY use a user-defined relationship type. As
// an example, a user might want to link malware directly to a tool. They can
// do so using related-to to say that the Malware is related to the Tool but
// not describe how, or they could use delivered-by (a user-defined name they
// determined) to indicate more detail.

	// and is limited to characters a–z (lowercase ASCII), 0–9, and hyphen (-).

	// to be true. If start_time and stop_time are both defined, then stop_time
