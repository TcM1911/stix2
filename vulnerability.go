// Vulnerability is "a mistake in software that can be directly used by a
// hacker to gain access to a system or network". For example, if a piece of
// malware exploits CVE-2015-12345, a Malware object could be linked to a
// Vulnerability object that references CVE-2015-12345. CVE is a list of
// information security vulnerabilities and exposures that provides common
// names for publicly known problems.
//
// The Vulnerability SDO is primarily used to link to external definitions of
// vulnerabilities or to describe 0-day vulnerabilities that do not yet have an
// external definition. Typically, other SDOs assert relationships to
// Vulnerability objects when a specific vulnerability is targeted and
// exploited as part of malicious cyber activity. As such, Vulnerability
// objects can be used as a linkage to the asset management and compliance
// process.
