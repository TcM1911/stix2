// Note is intended to convey informative text to provide further context
// and/or to provide additional analysis not contained in the STIX Objects,
// Marking Definition objects, or Language Content objects which the Note
// relates to. Notes can be created by anyone (not just the original object
// creator). For example, an analyst may add a Note to a Campaign object
// created by another organization indicating that they've seen posts related
// to that Campaign on a hacker forum. Because Notes are typically (though not
// always) created by human analysts and are comprised of human-oriented text,
// they contain an additional property to capture the analyst(s) that created
// the Note. This is distinct from the created_by_ref property, which is meant
// to capture the organization that created the object.
