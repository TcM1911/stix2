// Sighting denotes the belief that something in CTI (e.g., an indicator,
// malware, tool, threat actor, etc.) was seen. Sightings are used to track who
// and what are being targeted, how attacks are carried out, and to track
// trends in attack behavior.
//
// The Sighting relationship object is a special type of SRO; it is a
// relationship that contains extra properties not present on the Generic
// Relationship object. These extra properties are included to represent data
// specific to sighting relationships (e.g., count, representing how many times
// something was seen), but for other purposes a Sighting can be thought of as
// a Relationship with a name of "sighting-of". Sighting is captured as a
// relationship because you cannot have a sighting unless you have something
// that has been sighted. Sighting does not make sense without the relationship
// to what was sighted.
//
// Sighting relationships relate three aspects of the sighting:
//
//		* What was sighted, such as the Indicator, Malware, Campaign, or other
//		  SDO (sighting_of_ref)
//		* Who sighted it and/or where it was sighted, represented as an
//		  Identity (where_sighted_refs) and
//		* What was actually seen on systems and networks, represented as
//		  Observed Data (observed_data_refs)
//
// What was sighted is required; a sighting does not make sense unless you say
// what you saw. Who sighted it, where it was sighted, and what was actually
// seen are optional. In many cases it is not necessary to provide that level
// of detail in order to provide value.
//
// Sightings are used whenever any SDO has been "seen". In some cases, the
// object creator wishes to convey very little information about the sighting;
// the details might be sensitive, but the fact that they saw a malware
// instance or threat actor could still be very useful. In other cases,
// providing the details may be helpful or even necessary; saying exactly which
// of the 1000 IP addresses in an indicator were sighted is helpful when
// tracking which of those IPs is still malicious.

	// Count if present, this MUST be an integer between 0 and 999,999,999

	// called NumberObserved, which refers to the number of times the data was
	// observed. These counts refer to different concepts and are distinct. For
	// example, a single sighting of a DDoS bot might have many millions of
	// observations of the network traffic that it generates. Thus, the
	// Sighting count would be 1 (the bot was observed once) but the Observed
	// Data NumberObserved would be much higher. As another example, a sighting
	// with a count of 0 can be used to express that an indicator was not seen

	// was seen by the object creator, an Identity representing the object
	// creator should be listed in WhereSighted. This property MUST reference
